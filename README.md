[JavaScript: Getting Started - Function Scope (Video) ~4m ](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=2ed526cb-d986-44bc-898e-aca04d54cbb5)

1. Create a function named `greeting` that prints the "Hello World" to the console.

2. Create a function named `countingCharacters` that takes a `string` as a parameter.
    - If the length of the string is less than 10, print the strings length to the console 
    - If the string length is more than 10, print a message that the string is too long and include the string in the message.

3. Create a function named `difference` that accepts two numbers as parameters. 
    - If either of the parameters provided is not a number, the function should `return` the following error: "Input(s) must be a number!". 
    - It should `return` the difference if both parameters are numbers. 
    - Call the function within a `console.log()` statement to print the information returned from the function. This is different than having the function print to the console directly.
```js
/*
    Examples: 
    difference("hello", 3) // "Input(s) must be a number!"
    difference(3, 5) // 2
    difference(5, 1) // 4
 */
 ```

4. Using the function expression syntax, create a new function named `advancedGreeting`.
    - It should accept `hour` as a parameter
    - If the hour is less than 12, return a "Good morning" greeting
    - If the hour is between 12 and 18, return a "Good afternoon" greeting
    - If the hour is between 18 and 24, return a "Good night" greeting
    - All other values should return "Invalid hour input".

5. Can we access variables created inside the scope of a function outside of that function? Can a function access variables created in a parent scope?

## Working with Arrays

1. What are two ways you can create an array in JavaScript?

2. How can we we tell if a variable is holding an array?

3. What data type is returned from an array with the `typeof`?

4. What is an index in the context of an array?

5. Given the following array, `const carMakes = ["Honda", "Toyota", "Mazda"]`
    - On a separate line use a built-in array method to add "Mercedes" to the end of the array
    - On a separate line use a built-in array method to add "BMW" to the beginning of the array
    - Print "Toyota" to the console accessing it by it's index

6. Using a built-in array method, create a new array from the first 3 values in the carMakes array and store it in a new variable. Your new array should contain the values `["BMW", "Honda", "Toyota"]`

7. Using built-in Array Methods and working with this array: `const ericInfo = ["Eric", "Senior Instructor", "Florida"];`
    - Remove "Eric" from the `ericInfo` array
    - Update "Florida" to "South Carolina"
    - Add "Schwartz" to the end of the array
    - The final array should look like this: ["Senior Instructor", "South Carolina", "Schwartz"]
    - Please feel free to look up array methods that you can use to accomplish the transformation above.

8. Print "apple" from each of the arrays below to the console
```js
const fruits1 = ["apple", "pear", "strawberry", "grape"];
const fruits2 = [
  ["strawberry", "grape"],
  ["rambutan", "durian"],
  ["orange", "apple"]
];
const fruits3 = [
  ["strawberry", ["pineapple"]],
  ["grape", ["pear", ["apple"], "kiwi"]]
];
```

9. Loop through the following array with a `for()` or `while()` loop printing each name to the console.
```js
const studentsArray = ["Annmarie", "Craig", "Ashley", "Joyce", "Deb", "Gabriel", "Kimmy", "Matt", "James", "Nicole", "Todd"]
```

10. Loop through the following array with the `forEach()` Array method printing each name and the names index to the console.
```js

/*
Example Output:

0: Ashley
1: Craig
...

*/
const studentsArray = ["Annmarie", "Craig", "Ashley", "Joyce", "Deb", "Gabriel", "Kimmy", "Matt", "James", "Nicole", "Todd"]
```

11. Using the  the `map` Array method square every number in the following array and save the results to a new array called `numbersSquaredArray`.
```js
const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

12. Using a looping method of your choice, loop over and sum all the values the new `numbersSqauredArray` storing the sum in a variable named `arraySum`. Print `arraySum` to the console.


13. Given the following array, use a built-in array method to check if the array contains "Luke Skywalker" and if it does, print its index to the console.
```js
const starWarsCharactersArray = ["Yoda", 'Darth Vader', 'Leia Organa', 'Luke Skywalker', 'Anakin Skywalker'];
```

## Working with Objects

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Object Properties (Video) ~5m ](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=5667e465-8dd0-45c8-8882-5d9aa4bb4e14)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Object Methods (Video) ~4m ](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=62c078a5-a060-49bd-a72e-269572d10b23)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Passing Objects to Functions (Video) ~4m ](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=010af6c1-a0bc-47e5-b321-8f41c88ee2a5)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Standard Built-in Objects (Video) ~7m ](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=92d9c29c-b215-47d7-bbe9-90aa3cf599b4)

1. Create an object that represents a person
    - the object should have a name, an age, and a favorite color.
    - using `console.log()` outside of the object, access the properties of the object to print: "Hello, My name is *name*. I am *age* years old and my favorite color is *favoriteColor*". Replacing the italic words with the correct property from the object.

2. Add a method called `sayHello` to the person object created above that returns the same message that the previous `console.log()` printed to the console. Be sure to use the properties within the object to replace the italicized words. Below the object, call the new method within a `console.log()` statement.

3. Given the object below that represents a student, add a method `averageGrade` that returns the average grade for the student by averaging the students `grades` array. Make sure you test the method by printing the average grade to the console.
```js
let studentBob = {
    name: "bob",
    age: 23,
    major: "Psychology",
    grades: [70, 92, 84, 75, 100]
}
```

4. Add a new method to the `studentBob` object called `printDetails` that prints: "Hello, My name is *name* and I am a student. I am *age* years old and my major is *major*. My current average grade is *averageGrade*. 

5. Loop through the following array of objects and print out the name property of each object to the console. As a bonus, see if you can find a string method that would make the names appear with all uppercase letters when printed.
```js
const charactersArray = [
    {
        name: 'Luke Skywalker',
        height: '172',
        mass: '77',
        eye_color: 'blue',
        gender: 'male',
    },
    {
        name: 'Darth Vader',
        height: '202',
        mass: '136',
        eye_color: 'yellow',
        gender: 'male',
    },
    {
        name: 'Leia Organa',
        height: '150',
        mass: '49',
        eye_color: 'brown',
        gender: 'female',
    },
    {
        name: 'Anakin Skywalker',
        height: '188',
        mass: '84',
        eye_color: 'blue',
        gender: 'male',
    },
];
```

6. Using the `Array.filter()` method on `charactersArray`, create a new array called `filteredCharactersArray` that only contains characters where the `mass` is greater than 80.

7. Using the `Array.map()` method on `charactersArray`, create a new array called `characterNames` that only contains names of each character as a string.

8. Using the `Array.some()` method on `charactersArray`. Check to see if a character has blue eyes. If they do, print "Some characters have blue eyes" otherwise print "No characters have blue eyes" to the console. 

9. Using the `Array.every()` method on `charactersArray`. Check to see if all characters are male. If they every character is male, print "All the characters are male" to the console.

10. Using a **loop or `Array.reduce()`** calculate the total mass of all the characters. Print the total mass to the console.

11. Create a function called `tagFavorite` that takes an `array` as one parameter and a `string` that represents your favorite character's name as another parameter. **This function does not need to return anything.**
    - Create a loop inside the function that loops over the array passed in.
    - Add a property to each object in the array called `favoriteCharacter` and default it to `false`
    - If the character name matches the character name passed in, set the `favoriteCharacter` property to true for that character's object
    - Test your function by passing in the `charactersArray` and your favorite character's name when running the function. Print the `charactersArray` after you run the function to ensure the objects updated properly.

## Working with the DOM

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Using Functions to Modify Web Pages (Video) ~4m](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=234071ed-da20-40ea-bdaf-89eebcb6edb8)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - The Document Object Model (Video) ~4m](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=77583204-5d22-47f8-85bb-b901989e0681)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Styling DOM Elements (Video) ~4m](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=33a898d8-6900-4d4f-ac53-1b02c3df8c57)

[JavaScript: Getting Started - Detecting Button Clicks (Video) ~3m](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=18e3cc62-ebcb-4d06-942c-a7afba796ca5)

1. What is the `DOM` in relation to web development?

2. **On your own:** What is the difference between `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelector()`.

3. What method could I use on the document object to find an HTML element by one of the classes in the elements class list if `document.querySelector()` was not available?

4. **On your own:** What is the difference between using `*element*.addEventListener()` vs `*element*.onclick`?

5. Add a `button` HTML element to the `<body>` of `index.html`  and give the new button an `id` attribute with a value of your choosing. You can just open the HTML file and add this. For now, **DO NOT** put any text between the opening and closing button tags.
    - Using JavaScript, get a reference to the button element using it's `id` and store it in a variable. Print the value of the variable to the console to verify that you were able to get a reference to the expected element.
    - Using JavaScript, update the button element to have the text, "Click Me".
    - Using JavaScript, update the button element to have white text and a black background.

6. Add an event listener to the button you created that responds to a click event. Print something to the console so you know that something happens when the button is clicked and your event listener is working.

7. Add a `span` HTML element to the `<body>` of `index.html` after the button and give the new span an `id` attribute with a value `counter`. Use a 0 as the contents of your span.
    - Using JavaScript, get a reference to the span element using it's `id` and store it in a variable. Print the value of the variable to the console to verify that you were able to get a reference to the expected element.
    - Update the event listener for the `button` to increase the 0 in the `span` by one every time the button is clicked. 

8. **Add a new event listener** to the button you created that responds to a right-click event (the actual event is called something else). Print something to the console so you know that something happens when the button is right-clicked and your event listener is working.
    - Be sure to use `event.preventDefault();` near the top of the event listener.
    - What behavior did adding `event.preventDefault();` change?
    - Update the new event listener for the `button` to decrease the number in the `span` by one every time the button is clicked.

9. Given the following function that returns a random color from an array, change the background color of the HTML document every time the button is clicked or right-clicked.
```js
function randomColor() {
    const colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
    
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * ((colors.length - 1) - 0 + 1) + 0)
    
    return colors[randomIndex]
}
```

10. Build the contents of a table with JavaScript
    - Add the following table structure to `index.html`. You are not permitted to edit this table structure unless it is with JavaScript.
    ```html
     <table id="quizQuestionsTable">
        <thead>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Question</th>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Answer</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

        </tbody>
    </table>
    ```
    - Using JavaScript, get a reference to the `tbody` element using `document.querySelector()` passing it the right `selector` to target the `tbody` of the table and store it in a variable. Print the value of the variable to the console to verify that you were able to get a reference to the expected element.
    - Looping over the following array of objects (quizQuestions), add a table row for each object in the array only populating the data that is in the header row provided.
    ```js
    let quizQuestions = [
        {
            "id": 79680,
            "answer": "anarchy",

            }
        }
    ]
    ```
    - The result of the first iteration of the loop would add the following structure to the `tbody` and repeat for each question in the array.
    ```html
        <tr>
            <td>79680</td>
            <td>In 1921 the black flag flew at the funeral of Peter Kropotkin, philosopher of this government-negating ideology</td>
            <td>political science</td>
            <td>1000</td>
            <td>anarchy</td>
        </tr>
    ```
